### Delivery and Timing
We will meet in person once a week on Thursdays from 1:30 to 4:10 in AB 1020 with occasional meetings at The MIX, Horizon Hall 1408. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete workshops, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 15 weeks and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.

### Prerequisites
AVT 414: Corporate Design and Branding

### Course Description
This is an advanced design course that will focus on 2-d and 3-d design concepts and production. Students will learn the techniques, concepts, and processes essential to understanding how to create and execute a packaging project, from ideation to final product.

Students will participate in all aspects of the development, design, assembly and presentation of package design projects. This will include concept development, research, writing, production, and presentation. 

### Objectives
* Refine visual design skills on 3-d containers
* Build 3-d design skills from concept to physical form
* Develop craft skill including cutting, folding, gluing, taping
* Learn and demonstrate proficiency in 3-d prototyping tools such as 3-d printers and laser cutters
* Develop a project based on exploration, process, and iteration
* Exercise good time management skills
* Build skills when working within a group

### Required Materials
* Cutting Tool (Olfa, Xacto, etc.)
* Extra Blades
* Cutting Mat (12x18 minimum)
* Metal, cork backed ruler (18 inches minimum)
* Scissors
* Glue stick
* Tacky Glue (Aleene’s, Sobo)
* Clear Tape
* Masking Tape

### As Needed Materials
* Cardboard
* Chipboard
* Paper
* Wood
* Acrylic

### Required Software
* Adobe CC
* Tinkercad (free and web based)

### Content
This class consists of  shorter exercises, in-class demos and workshops, and longer projects. The exercises, demos, and workshops are meant to build skills and learn new concepts and the projects are a place to demonstrate your understanding and ability to combine those skills and concepts.

### Projects

#### project 1: starter pack
Create a starter kit that has, what you considered, the three most important items for a graphic designer. You can choose any items, but they must be able to fit into a package that you can design and build. You will also create a name and a visual identity for your package.

#### project 2: form + function
You and a partner will work on a sustainable package design together with the goals of minimizing the materials used for the packaging, minimizing the waste created by the production process, and designing a container that can be reused in some way that is relevant to the item it is containing. You will also create a visual identity and design for the packaging.

### Attendance
Your attendance is tied to your engagement grade. Each class you miss will lower your engagement grade by 25 points unless you let me know you won't be in class and make an effort to cover what you missed in class, scheduling office hours for example. Each class you are late to will lower your engagement grade by 10 points unless you let me know. If you miss four or more classes you will automatically fail the class unless you have communicated with me prior to the fourth absence.

### Engagement
This course has an engagement policy instead of an attendance policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.

* Attend class meetings
* Create things and be prepared to show them on time.
* Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.
* Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.
* Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.
* Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.
* Care about yourself & your work, your classmates & their work, and this class.

### Grading
Grades will be based on engagement (25%), exercises (25%), and projects (50%).

#### engagement (25%)
This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on previous page but will include attendance, discussion, critiques, and overall participation. Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.

#### exercises (25%)
The exercises are graded using one of two basic rubrics shown below. The rubric that is used depends on whether it was a coding or design exercise and include your ability to follow the instructions of the exercise and your ability to submit it on time. The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your coding and design knowledge.

#### projects  (50%)
Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your ability to submit the required, weekly checkpoints for the project. These weekly checkpoints use a simple rubric based on your effort, timeliness, improvement, and completion. The second grade will be based on the final project you submit and has a more extensive rubric. At the end of the semester you will have 4 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 50%.

### Late Work
Late work will be accepted for three weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project which will be due at the end of the semester. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade. 

#### rubrics
Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are available in the PDF syllabus and attached to the assignments on Canvas.

### Communication
Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.

The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.

### Weekly Schedule
Class is on Thursday from 1:30–4:10pm. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.

A note&mdash;Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn't budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn't healthy and, especially now, making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.

### Semester Schedule
The [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this fall. It is subject to additions, subtractions, and shifts.

### Discussion of Work
You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.

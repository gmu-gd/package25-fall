excerpt: Create a variety pack that contains three versions of one item.
---
### Description
Design and construct a package that contains three variations of the same (or similar) item. You will create a visual identity, design for the container of the items, and the labels/packaging for the items themselves. The design of the items must work as a system, not as three individual designs.

#### Things to Keep in Mind
* What information should be on the main package versus the individual items?
* How complex or simple should a design system be?
* How is the variety on the inside shown on the outside?
* Craft is just as important as the design
* The unboxing experience

#### Objectives
* Craft skills â€“ cutting, folding, taping, gluing
* Working in 2-D and 3-D
* Branding as it relates to package design
* Creating digital mockups

#### Checkpoints
* <span class="due">10/23/25_#1</span> &ndash; two ideas for variety pack, brand name, item names/varieties, reference imagery for physical packaging and visual design
* <span class="due">10/30/25_#2</span> &ndash; 10 sketches for logos and two concept sketches for the visual design of one of the individual items.
* <span class="due">11/06/25_#3</span> &ndash; basic brand guide showing logo, type, colors, mood, etc., initial visual designs for variations, low fidelity prototype
* <span class="due">11/13/25_#4</span> &ndash; initial design of containing package, refined design of items applied to all three variations, refined prototype
* <span class="due">11/20/25_#5</span> &ndash; initial digital mockups, high fidelity prototype, visual design on prototype
* <span class="due">12/04/25_#6</span> &ndash; flex week
* <span class="due">12/11/25_FINAL</span> &ndash; final submission due

#### Requirements
* Name for product
* Consistent visual brand
* Design of containing package
* Design of three items
* Packaging uses one tool from The MIX

#### Final Submission
* Turned in on time (12/11/25)
* Physical package with designs on it and individual items
* Digital mockups
* PDFs of dieline and/or cut files
* Images of physical package
* All images and pdfs on Canvas
* All requirements met
